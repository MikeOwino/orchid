This is a minimal JS entry point that exports the WalletConnectEthereumProvider 
from the @walletconnect/ethereum-provider package into the environment so that 
Flutter can interact with it through JS interop.

The alternative might be to use a published UMD package like the one used with 
Wallet Connect v1.  However, I was unable to find one.

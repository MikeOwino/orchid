# Twin Coding is a hybrid encoding scheme that works with any two linear
# coding schemes and combines them to achieve a space-bandwidth tradeoff,
# minimizing the amount of data that must be transferred between storage
# nodes in order to recover a lost shard of data.
#
# Two copies of the data are encoded, one using each of the sub-schemes,
# and then split among corresponding sets of nodes. Unlike a traditional k of n
# coding scheme in which the reconstruction of a single lost shard requires
# gathering the full data from k nodes, Twin Coding allows nodes to cooperate
# by performing a computation and transferring a smaller amount of data,
# reducing the total transfer to exactly the size of the lost shard.

# Specifically, a message of k^2 symbols in length is broken encoded into
# k-length shards. Utilizing twin coding the recovery of a shard requires
# downloading only a single (calculated) symbol from any k nodes of the
# alternate node type.  This is in contrast to the k^2 symbols that would
# be required with a single coding scheme.
#
# The message is reshaped to a k x k matrix and encoded using the supplied
# generator matrices of the code schemes into two, k x n, matrices. Each
# column of the encoded matrices is then assigned to a node of its respective
# type, resulting in two distinct sets of n nodes.
#
# message:
# The message to be encoded. This is an array of k^2 symbols length.
#
# C0, C1:
# The supplied pair of coding schemes can be any k of n linear codes (e.g.
# Reed-Solomon). They may be the same or different schemes. They should
# share k but may have different encoded lengths n.
#
# Return:
# This method returns the two lists of n column vectors to be stored at the
# respective node types. The two node sets will be different sizes if the codes
# have different n values.

# Construct a Reed Solomon generator matrix for consecutive evaluation points
# of the specified Galois field. This is a k x n matrix where each column
# corresponds to an evaluation point and holds consecutive powers of
# that value (e.g. x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3, ...).  Multiplying on the left by a
# row vector of k data symbols produces a polynomial of degree k-1 having
# coefficients of the k data points multiplying consecutive powers of the
# evaluation point, comprising an evaluation of the polynomial at that point.
# (e.g. k0 + k1*x + k2*x^2 + k3*x^3...) The end result is a row vector of n
# symbols, each corresponding to an evaluation of the polynomial at its
# column's eval point.
#
# Note: This is the same as the transpose of the Vandermonde matrix. However,
# we cannot use np.vander() here because the galois package does not override
# it to operate on GF elements.

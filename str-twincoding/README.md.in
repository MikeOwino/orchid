## About

Twin Coding is a hybrid encoding scheme that works with any two linear coding schemes and combines
them to achieve a space-bandwidth tradeoff, minimizing the amount of data that must be transferred
between storage nodes in order to recover a lost shard of data. In contrast to a traditional
erasure scheme, in which restoration of a lost node requires a full reconstruction of the original
file, Twin Coding allows for the recovery of a lost data shard with data transfer totalling exactly
the size of the lost data shard, with no additional transfer overhead.

This repository contains an implementation of Twin Coding, as well as a command line API for encoding 
files, decoding files with erasures, and optimally recovering lost shards.

See `twin_coding.py` for an explanation of the algorithm, example code, and a link to the original paper.
